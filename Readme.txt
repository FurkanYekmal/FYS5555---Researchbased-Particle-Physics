The course FYS5555 - Researchbased Particle Physics was teached by Farid Ould-Saalda originally. I did most of the work then. This year it is taught by Eirik Gramstad.

I did three projects. One qualitative Particle Physics, one review of some project work we did at CERN and finally a major project about finding Dark Matter.
